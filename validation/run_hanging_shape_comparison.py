"""Compare the solved kite shape against the 3D photogrammetry markers.

The twelve published lengths are only six independent numbers, with no height
and no chordwise measure among them, so they cannot decide whether a model has
the right *shape*. Haanen's marker clouds can: 62--76 three-dimensional points
per load case on the leading edge, the eight struts and the canopy.

    https://github.com/pimjhaanen/photogrammetry_thesis

Alignment
---------
The markers are in the stereo rig's frame, so model and measurement must be
brought together before anything can be compared. Only a *rigid* transform is
allowed --- rotation and translation, never scale --- because scale is exactly
the thing under test.

Correspondence comes from structure, not from fitting: measured ``strut0``
through ``strut7`` are ordered across the span and their first marker sits at
the leading edge, so their roots pair with the model's eight strut leading-edge
nodes. That gives eight anchors for an initial Kabsch fit, tried in both
spanwise orderings because the kite is near-symmetric and the marker numbering
direction is not documented. The fit is then refined by ICP against the model
*curves* (each measured marker to the nearest point on its own polyline), which
removes the assumption that a marker sits exactly on a model node.

What is reported
----------------
Point-to-curve RMS per marker group. This is the honest error measure for a
shape: it does not require a marker to correspond to a node, and it cannot be
reduced by sliding markers along the structure.
